                <p>
                    A man found a cocoon of a butterfly.

                    One day a small opening appeared. He sat and watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole.
                    
                    Until it suddenly stopped making any progress and looked like it was stuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily, although it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.
                    
                    The man didnt think anything of it and sat there waiting for the wings to enlarge to support the butterfly. But that didnt happen. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    The butterfly spent the rest of its life unable to fly, crawling around with tiny wings and a swollen body.
                    
                    Despite the kind heart of the man, he didnt understand that the restricting cocoon and the struggle needed by the butterfly to get itself through the small opening; were Gods way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings. To prepare itself for flying once it was out of the cocoon.
                </p>
